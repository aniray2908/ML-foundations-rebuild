# ML Foundations Rebuild

A 6-week structured sprint to strengthen:

- Linear algebra depth
- Statistical learning maturity
- MLOps and production readiness
- Data engineering fundamentals

This repository documents conceptual understanding, mathematical derivations, and implementation work.

---

## Week 1 – Linear Algebra Foundations

### Covered
- Matrix multiplication (manual implementation)
- Linear transformations (geometric view)
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Verification of Av = λv
- Singular Value Decomposition (A = UΣVᵀ)
- Principal Component Analysis (derived from covariance & SVD)

### Key Outcome:
Understanding ML models as structured linear transformations, not black boxes.
