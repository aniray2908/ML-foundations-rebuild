# Statistical Learning

This section focuses on understanding model behavior, regularization, and structured model selection.

The goal is to move from:

“Fitting models”

to

“Understanding generalization and model complexity.”

## 📓 Implementation Notebooks

- 01_bias_variance_demo.ipynb  
- 02_ridge_vs_lasso.ipynb  
- 03_cross_validation_and_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb  
- 04_model_comparison.ipynb  

These notebooks demonstrate:

- Visual bias–variance behavior

## Key Learning Outcome

- Bias–variance governs model behavior.
- Regularization controls variance.
- Cross-validation estimates generalization error.
- Model choice depends on signal structure.
