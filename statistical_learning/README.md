# Statistical Learning

This section focuses on understanding model behavior, regularization, classification, ensemble methods, and disciplined model evaluation.

The goal is to move from:

“Fitting models”

to

“Understanding generalization, model complexity, and decision impact.”

## Key Learning Outcome

After completing this module:

- Bias–variance reasoning is internalized.
- Regularization mechanics are understood mathematically and intuitively.
- Linear and nonlinear classifiers are structurally compared.
- Ensemble variance reduction is understood conceptually.
- Evaluation metrics are chosen based on class imbalance and cost asymmetry.
- Calibration and discrimination are clearly distinguished.

Statistical learning foundations are complete.
